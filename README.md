# C-data-structures

This repository contains a list of data structures in the C language. The objective of these data structures is to store generic instances while being simple, lightweight, efficient, and secure memory-wise.

This repository includes data structures for arrays, vectors, and dictionary-type structures. Additionally, it also includes test files for testing the various implemented data structures.
