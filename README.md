# C-data-structures

This repository contains a series of data structures made using the C language. These simple data structures have the objective of storing any type of data according to some rules depending on their type.

This repository includes data structures for arrays, vectors, and dictionary-type (not available yet) structures. Additionally, it also includes test files for testing the various implemented data structures.
